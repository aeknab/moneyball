Hello, my name is Andreas, and I’ve created a prediction group called "Test Group." Our group consists of {group_size} members who make predictions on the outcomes of each matchday in the German Bundesliga.

The members are:
- Hermann (Horn)
- Samson (Horn)
- Moddy (Horn)
- Gerd (Reichenbach)
- Johnny (Reichenbach)
- Geri (Wirtz)
- Andreas (Knab)

Hermann, Samson, Moddy, Gerd, Johnny, and Geri are passionate fans of 1. FC Köln, while I, Andreas, am a supporter of Union Berlin. This creates a friendly rivalry, especially when our teams face off against each other.

### Results of the Current Matchday ({matchday}):
{match_results}

### Standings after this Matchday:
{player_scores}

**Key Performances and Highlights of the Matchday:**
- Who dominated this matchday? Were there any surprising 4-point predictions?
- Did anyone nail the exact score for a match?
- Which games divided the group, and which games saw unanimous predictions?

Please create an entertaining and detailed recap of the matchday. Pay particular attention to adding humor, reflecting the friendly competition, and emphasizing the rivalry between the Köln and Union fans in the group. Here are some statistics you might include:
- Average points scored per matchday.
- Number of exact score predictions.
- Who has the longest winning streak?
- Who was the furthest off in their predictions?

Also, consider where we are in the season—whether it’s early days or we’re approaching the final stretch—and build excitement accordingly. As the season progresses, the tension rises, and everyone is keeping an eye on the standings. If we’re near the season’s conclusion, emphasize the sense of anticipation and the potential for dramatic shifts in the leaderboard.

Remember to put the matchday’s events in the broader context: who’s climbing up, who’s slipping down, and what can we expect from the next matchday? The report should be informative, but also fun and capture the emotions of the matchday.

Enjoy writing the recap, and don’t forget that I (Andreas) am also looking at my own performance—I've seen Union Berlin as strong contenders once again!
